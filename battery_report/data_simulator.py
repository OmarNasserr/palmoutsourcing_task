    """
    Generate a realistic mock EV battery diagnostic log.
    
    This function simulates data from an electric vehicle's battery management system,
    including individual cell metrics, cycle counts, and capacity measurements.
    
    Returns:
        Dict[str, Any]: A dictionary containing:
            - vehicle_id: Unique vehicle identifier
            - timestamp: ISO 8601 formatted timestamp
            - cells: List of cell data (id, voltage, temperature)
            - cycle_count: Number of charge/discharge cycles
            - nominal_capacity_kwh: Manufacturer-rated capacity
            - current_capacity_kwh: Current measured capacity
    
    Data Simulation Strategy:
        - Cell count: Random between 80-120 cells (typical for EVs)
        - Voltages: 3.8-4.2V per cell (lithium-ion nominal range)
        - Temperatures: 25-45Â°C with occasional outliers for anomaly testing
        - Cycle count: 100-800 cycles (representing various vehicle ages)
        - Capacity degradation: Current capacity is 80-100% of nominal
